# Day 2193

> With the imminent demise of planet Earth, humanity has entrusted a team of scientists with the task of traveling to the hopeful planet Skarth. The ship, loaded with scientifically engineered plants that can terraform entire planets, soars through space on a long journey to build a new home. To survive the journey, the scientists cryogenically froze themselves and wrote a protection robot who maintains the ship's resources, tends to the plants and scientists, and ensures the ship stays on course. However, as the ship travels through space it encounters a vicious race of fuzzy aliens ready to destroy anything in their path. This robots __ritual__ now becomes a race to manage the resources on the ship to ensure humanity survives.
